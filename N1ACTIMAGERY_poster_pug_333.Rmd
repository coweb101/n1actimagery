This file documents statistical analyses reported on the poster **Comparing sensory attenuation for sounds associated with motor imagery, action execution or observation**. 48 subjects participated in the study (of which 45 were included in the following analysis; three participants were excluded based on EEG data quality); each subject underwent a total of 100 trials of each motor-related sound condition as well as the cued external sound condition. The (uncued) external sound condition was administered twice such that each participant underwent a total of 200 trials of this condition (once at the beginning and once in the middle of the experiment). The motor-related sound conditions and the cued external sound conditions were once administered with sounds and once without (Control). As is standard in the contingent paradigm (Horvath, 2015), difference waves are constructed between these conditions (i.e. the corresponding sound and no-sound conditions). In the following script, amplitude data is analyzed that already underwent these aggregation steps. 

R version 4.0.3 (2020-10-10), running under Windows 10 x64 (build 19044), was used to generate this document.
